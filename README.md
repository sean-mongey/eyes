<!--------------Summary---------------->
This program has a set of eyes that follow your mouse's every move.
<!-------------How to Use----------------->
Simply load the screen and move the mouse over the window.
<!------Future Improvements---------------->
I would like to add a number of themes.

- Create a cat face background
- change the pointer into a cookie for a cookie monster theme
- Make a drunk face swapping the pointer out for a beer and give the eyes a delayed reaction.
