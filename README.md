## Summary
**Following Eyes** is a simple interactive web application featuring a set of animated eyes that track the movement of your mouse cursor. As you move the cursor around the screen, the pupils (black balls) adjust their position accordingly, creating a fun and engaging effect.

## How It Works
The project consists of three main files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage and links the CSS and JavaScript.
- **styles.css**: Defines the styling of the eyes, background, and overall layout.
- **eyes.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic that dynamically adjusts the position of the pupils based on the cursor's coordinates.

### JavaScript Mechanics
- The script captures the cursor’s position using `event.clientX` and `event.clientY`.
- It then calculates the relative position of the cursor in percentage terms.
- The pupil elements (`.ball`) are updated to move accordingly, creating the effect of following eyes.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in a web browser.
2. Move your mouse anywhere within the browser window.
3. Watch as the eyes track your cursor!

## Installation
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Enjoy the interactive experience!

## Future Improvements
We plan to introduce additional themes and enhancements, including:
- A **cat face** background where the eyes mimic a cat’s gaze.
- A **cookie monster** theme where the cursor changes into a cookie.
- A **drunk effect**, where the cursor turns into a beer mug, and the pupils react with a delayed, exaggerated movement.
